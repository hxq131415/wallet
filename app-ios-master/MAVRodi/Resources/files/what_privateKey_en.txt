What is Private Key

We often say that your control over the money in your wallet depends on ownership and control of the corresponding private key. In blockchain transactions, the private key is used to generate the signatures necessary for the payment currency to prove ownership of the funds. The private key must always be kept confidential, because once leaked to a third party, the assets protected by the private key are also surrendered. It is different from the Keystore, which is a private key file encrypted. As long as the password is strong enough, even if the hacker gets the Keystore, it is difficult enough to crack. The private key stored in the user's wallet is completely independent and can be generated and managed by the user's wallet software without blockchain or network connection. The user's wallet address is calculated by the public key through keccak256, which is obtained after interception by 40 bits + 0x. The style of the private key for 64 - bit string of hexadecimal hash values, such as: h1266atveyokjwy2hw1l58foz0qmpm9rhw97xkx78uebb4lmw2ljodc7wunte6so
